        <p><b>INTRODUCTION:</b> Roger is a library catalog for UC San Diego that allows students to search for
            the availability of both electronic and print publications within the university's library. If a student
            finds an available print item at either UC San Diego libraries through the catalog, they can use the
            request feature to have it delievered to a pickup location. Students can also access course-related
            material through the Course Reserves, which allows professors to reserve certain publications for their
            class.

                    design for the new website design to reduce the mistakes and errors commonly made by students.

            <p><b>USER RESEARCH: </b>We asked users to login to their library account through Roger, search for and
                request a book for checkout and then asked if they could lookup one of their course reserve texts.
                Each user was asked to tell us their thought process during the interview so we could better
                understand why they made an action. Once we conducted a considerable amount of interviews, we
                gathered data from each team member to analyze the most frequent mistakes and errors made by each
                user.</p>

            <p><b>HOME PAGE: </b>There was a lot of design aspects that the team needed to consider because each of our
                choices would have a tradeoff. By removing several of the links in the home page, students would lose
                access to renewing items and the RSS feeds. Although it's good to have the options visible when needed,
                we decided to remove most of the links so users could avoid confusion due to the clutter that the links
                caused. We splashed on a few colors to better represent our university and to differentiate sections of
                the site.</p>

        <p><b>LOGIN PAGE: </b>One of the issues we found when conducting interviews was the amount of students who
            confused their PIN
            number with their student ID number when attempting to login to their library account. When the team
            was conducting interviews, we thought that it was a bit of a chore to login with a barcode number and a
            PIN number which were both unfamiliar to many students logging in. When students also wanted to access
            their course reserves, they were taken to a different site where they were asked to use a different set
            of login credentials. Roger 2.0 tries to incorporate the course reserves into the catalog and uses
            students' PID numbers so it would be less of a hassle for users to log in to access course reserves or
            using the library catalog.</p>

        <p><b>SEARCH RESULTS: </b>The team noticed that searching for publications bought up multiple entries for the
            same publication in
            the results page. We wanted each publication to have just one entry in the search results page, with
            each version (electronic, print, etc.) presented on the side to signify what version a user would want
            to check out. An additional feature that we planned to implement was an autocorrect that presented
            search results similar to what the user inputted incase of a typo or if users searched for a
            publication along the lines of their search.</p>
