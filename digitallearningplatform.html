        <p><b>Background</b></p>
        <p>Co-Create Change is a student run non-profit organization from UC San Diego with the purpose of helping the
            Myanmar community. They mainly focus on Myanmar education and want to promote socially just economic
            development in the community. The team I was worked with had the chance to partner with them by designing
            the framework for their digital learning platform. Co-Create Change aims to address educational
            inequalities by promoting local entrepreneurship. They wanted to accomplish this through promoting local
            entrepreneurship to serve as a communication and collaboration tool used to teach technical and business
            skills, and facilitate entrepreneurial ventures. Overall, Co-Create hopes that the this platform will lead
            college-aged students to start sustainable small businesses around renewable energy technology.</p>

    <div class="container col-md-7">
        <p><b>User Interviews</b></p>
        <p>We had Ana, who was the liaison for Co-Create Change, work with us throughout the quarter to design the
            digital learning platform. She was the first person we had an interview with and she was able to help us
            gain some knowledge about who we were designing for. We were able to learn about some of Co-Create Change’s
            past projects and their experiences working with the students in Myanmar.</p>
        <p>Due to the language barriers and time zone differences, Co-Create Change helped us interview some of the
            students in Myanmar. We learned that they had the technology such as computers and smartphones, but the
            internet in Myanmar wasn’t reliable and would go out frequently. We also learned more about the education
            system there and we wanted to create a solution that would work for all the villages across the country.
            From what we learned about the student life and education in Myanmar, we created two personas which can be
            seen below.</p>

    <div class="container col-md-7">
        <p><b>Ideation</b></p>
        <p>When thinking about what content to include in the site, we thought that product tutorials would help
            students understand the process of building products. The platform we had in mind was streamlined for the
            students to navigate through the different ideas we wanted to include. One of the issues we wanted to
            address most was how the students would work around the instability of the internet in Myanmar. Instead of
            having the platform run mainly on WiFi, we wanted to allow the option for students to download the lessons
            and tutorials that the platform would offer. Students would need to have access to internet in order to use
            the site, but after downloading, they wouldn’t have to rely solely on the internet connection to learn
            about entrepreneurship.</p>

    <br>

    <div class="container col-md-7">
        <p><b>Prototyping</b></p>
        <p>We wanted a way to combine all the ideas we had for the platform into one design, so we began creating a
            prototype. Our tool of choice was Figma which was used for all of our iterations. The ideas we had for the
            digital learning platform included a technical education, creating a business-oriented mindset, and the
            ability to network. For us to accomplish this, we wanted to create a platform that would teach students
            about entrepreneurship help them connect with local businesses under a website that all Myanmar students
            could access. Our creation included sections for a variety of purposes to allow students to expand their
            businesses.</p>

    <div class="container col-md-7">
        <p><b>User Testing</b></p>
        <p>We had Ana as well as other students test our prototype to gain some valuable feedback. Our feedback was
            limited with the amount of time the people we interviewed had but we were able to revise what we had from
            what we heard. From the feedback we received, we heard that in order to help promote design thinking within
            students, we should include a dedicated section to think ahead of our listed tutorials to grow even further
            as businesses. The business planner we had was also recommended to be included as a feature within the
            business section of the platform.</p>
