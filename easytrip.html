        <p><b>BACKGROUND: </b>When travelling to new locations, people might often have a few ideas of where they want
            to go for their vacation but would need other suggestions for the rest of their free time. There are a lot
            of things to keep track of when planning a vacation (what to bring with you, the best ticket and hotel
            prices, where to visit, what to eat, etc.) and it can stress people out if they’re overwhelmed and
            unfamiliar with how to plan for a vacation. Since our app is designed to help people find things to do, we
            enhance the user’s experiences before or during their time of travelling. We’re specifically designing for
            travellers who want to find more things to do when they have free time abroad.</p>
    </div>

    <br>
    <br>

    <div class="container col-md-7">
        <p><b>STORYBOADING: </b>We started this project by researching potential users and understanding what kind of
            issues they would face when trying to prepare for a vacation. We interviewed people from different
            backgrounds and had different frequencies for when they would travel. What we wanted from our interviews
            was to understand the pain points that users would experience the most.</p>

            </div>
            <br>
        <p>To help us to get a better understanding of what we wanted our app to accomplish, we created storyboards
            illustrating potential solutions to the problem. Our idea behind the app was to provide travelers with an
            easy way to find activities and locations that would interest them the most. In the first storyboard, the
            app is designed towards helping the user find activities for a group in a small amount of time. The second
            storyboard focuses on finding results based on the logistics of the people who are travelling. This is
            similar to the third storyboard, where the user is travelling with a family and wants everyone to be able
            to enjoy their time within the timeframe of the vacation.</p>

        <p><b>PROTOTYPING: </b>A paper prototype was developed to get a better sense of an ideal user flow and
            important features to include in the app. We wanted to separate our app from the others by having
            personalized suggestions for things to do. Recommendations will be based on the questions that we ask each
            user, such as who the user is going with (age range) and hobby preferences. When searching for things to do
            on Google Trips and TripAdvisor, activities are mainly organized by category. Users would still have to
            search through the categories since they aren’t very personalized. We want to implement this feature
            alongside a page where users can search for things to do as they’re planning for a trip. We wanted to
            implement a memories page so that users would be able to look back on their past trips (sort of like an
            Instagram profile or a timeline). This feature was meant to make the app more social and interactive while
            providing the user to look back on where they went before if they wanted to. For now, it’s a side goal so
            that we can focus on the main functions of the app.</p>

    <br>
    <br>

    <div class="container col-md-7">
        <p><b>WIREFRAMING: </b>From this point, we wanted to decide whether we wanted to develop a mobile app or an
            application for the web. We made wireframes for both potential platforms and weigh the differences between
            each of them. A mobile app would allow users to access EasyTrip from more locations, but the space within
            smartphones were very limited to work with. Although a web app would be used less often, we believed that
            it would be easier to work with given the space the space of a typical PC screen and the team’s programming
            background.</p>

    <br>
    <br>

    <div class="container col-md-7">
        <p><b>USER TESTING: </b>After creating a semi-functional app, we started to test EasyTrip with a few users to
            see study how users would use it. The biggest user errors that we observed were related to the search
            button. Because the search button is on top of the recommendations page, many of the testers were confused
            by its purpose. So, for our comparative evaluation, we are planning to separate the searching activities
            functionality and the recommendations functionality to be on two separate pages. Our new design will
            feature the recommendations on the bottom of the calendar page, since our app’s main functionality is to
            provide users with personalized recommendations. Then at the bottom, we will add a text suggesting the user
            to click on the link to search for activities if the recommendations do not match what they are looking
            for. By doing do, we think that it could reduce the time it takes for users to add an activity to their
            calendar, and also would ease any confusion about the purpose of the search bar and its positioning on top
            of the recommendations.</p>
