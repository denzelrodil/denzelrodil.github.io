        <p><b>Background</b></p>
        <p>The team noticed that searching for publications bought up multiple entries for the
            same publication in the results page. We wanted each publication to have just one entry in the search
            results page, with each version (electronic, print, etc.) presented on the side to signify what version
            a user would want to check out. An additional feature that we planned to implement was an autocorrect
            that presented search results similar to what the user inputted incase of a typo or if users searched
            for a publication along the lines of their search.</p>
